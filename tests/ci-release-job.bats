# ci-release-job.bats
# Structural invariants for the "Create Release" job in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#
# The release job is a chokepoint: mirror-official-deb, update-apt-repo,
# update-dnf-repo and update-aur-repo all carry `needs: [release]`, so a
# step that fails the job also withholds the release from every channel.
#
# On 2026-07-24 the claude-desktop-versions repo went private. Its
# checkout is `continue-on-error: true`, so it rendered as a green check
# while its `outcome` was failure — which skipped the four steps gated on
# that outcome, one of which installed asar for the entirely unrelated
# reference-source step. That step exited 127 (`asar: command not
# found`), failed the job, and the publish jobs never ran.
#
# These tests pin the decoupling: reference-source tooling installs
# unconditionally, and the step degrades to a warning if a tool is
# missing anyway.
#
# No YAML library is used — awk splits the job on its step boundaries,
# which keeps the suite on the bash/awk toolchain the rest of tests/ uses
# and adds no dependency. The parser is deliberately fragile in the
# visible direction: "the parser sees the expected shape" fails loudly if
# the indentation it keys on ever drifts, and every test below asserts
# its step block was actually found before reading anything out of it, so
# a vanished step reds the suite instead of passing on empty output.
