# Claude Desktop for Linux, repackaged from Anthropic's official .deb.
#
# Draft for the v3.0.0 official-deb rebase (ACQ-1); final shape is
# @typedrat's call. Design contract: docs/learnings/nix.md ("Target
# design for the rework"). nixpkgs precedent: discord, vscode — a
# vendor tarball/.deb unpacked and fixed up with autoPatchelfHook,
# keeping the vendored Chromium ELF (not run under a nixpkgs electron).
#
# Load-bearing invariants:
#
#   - The official tree is bare co-located (usr/lib/claude-desktop/
#     {claude-desktop, chrome-sandbox, resources/}). We copy that tree
#     whole — the ELF is a real file, never a symlink — so
#     /proc/self/exe resolves inside this store path and
#     process.resourcesPath is correct by construction. No nixpkgs
#     electron, no resourcesPath hack; docs/learnings/nix.md explains
#     why that must not return.
#
#   - check-claude-version auto-bumps this file with anchored seds
#     (docs/learnings/nix.md, "The SRI auto-bump contract"): it rewrites
#     the version line and range-seds each arch block's SRI hash. Keep
#     exactly one version assignment in this file and exactly one hash
#     assignment inside each arch block, and never write the literal
#     tokens the seds anchor on (version/hash followed by ` = "`)
#     anywhere else — not even in a comment, or the bump corrupts it.
#     The urls must derive from the version by interpolation so a bump
#     keeps them in sync.

  #     has turned strings into template literals before).
