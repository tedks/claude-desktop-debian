# Contributing

## Before you start

A few minutes here saves a round-trip later. Match your task to the right channel:

- **Found a bug?** File an [issue](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/new/choose)
  with the bug template. Paste full `claude-desktop --doctor` output;
  include distro, DE, and session type (Wayland/X11). See
  [Filing an issue](#filing-an-issue).
- **Have a fix in hand?** PRs that fix existing behaviour, restore parity
  with Windows/macOS, or improve packaging are always welcome. Open the
  PR; an issue isn't strictly required if the fix is small.
- **Want to add a new feature?** Open a [discussion](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/discussions)
  or an issue first. We're a repackager; most net-new behaviour is
  declined by default — see [What we accept](#what-we-accept).
- **Security concern?** Don't file a public issue. Use
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — GitHub Security Advisories route to
  @aaddrick privately (owner-only on a personal-account repo); @sabiut
  is looped in.

## What we accept

We're a repackager, not a fork. Net-new feature PRs default to no: we'd
own that behaviour across every re-minified upstream release.
Exception: parity patches for Windows features broken on Linux
(input methods, tray on Wayland/X11, frame defaults). Always welcome:

- Bug fixes against existing behaviour.
- Parity patches bringing Linux closer to the Windows build.
- Packaging, distribution, launcher fixes.
- Docs, tests, CI improvements.

## What goes upstream, not here

We patch the binary blob; we don't fix application logic inside it.
If the bug reproduces on Windows, file at
[anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code).
In-app `/bug` and `/feedback` are inert.

| File here                              | File upstream                       |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `apt update` errors, install failures  | Plugin install fails on all OSes    |
| Tray icon missing on KDE Wayland       | Conversation rendering glitch       |
| AppImage won't launch on distro X      | MCP server connection drops         |
| `--doctor` reports wrong diagnosis     | Account / login flow broken         |

## Filing an issue

1. Use the issue template, not freeform.
2. Paste full `./build.sh --doctor` (or `claude-desktop --doctor`)
   output. Most-skipped step.
3. Include distro, DE, session type (Wayland/X11). Most Linux-only
   bugs trace to one of these.
4. Reproduce on a clean config: move `~/.config/Claude` aside, relaunch.
   Stale config causes false positives.

## Patches against upstream

Patches live in `scripts/patches/*.sh`, one per subsystem; `build.sh`
sources them. Before writing or editing one, read [the
patching-minified-js learnings doc][pmj]: anchor selection, capture,
idempotency, beautified-vs-minified gap. Short form: CLAUDE.md §
Working with Minified JavaScript.

Priority rule: a broken-patch upstream release beats feature work.

## Subsystem owners

CODEOWNERS auto-requests reviews; this list is for human discoverability.

- **@sabiut**: project lead and default owner. Build, patches, desktop,
  packaging, docs, `tests/`, `scripts/doctor.sh`. Final say on
  direction and releases.
- **@aaddrick**: repository owner, so the owner-only surfaces stay here
  — repo settings, branch protection, Actions secrets, and security
  advisories —
  along with the release credentials (APT/DNF signing, the Cloudflare
  Worker). Co-owner on `.github/workflows/`, `worker/`, `RELEASING.md`,
  and `SECURITY.md`. Otherwise stepped back — still around for
  questions and for pressing the buttons only an owner can press.
  `REPO_VERSION` and `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_VERSION` are Actions *variables*,
  not secrets: any collaborator can bump them with `gh variable set`
  even though the Settings UI page is owner-only. Upstream-triggered
  releases need no one at all — `check-claude-version.yml` sets the
  version and pushes the tag itself.
- **@RayCharlizard**: Cowork (`scripts/patches/cowork-bwrap.sh`,
  `scripts/cowork-fallback/`, `tests/cowork-*.bats`).
- **@typedrat**: Nix (`flake.nix`, `flake.lock`, `/nix/`).

## Before submitting a PR

- Run `/lint` (or `shellcheck` + `actionlint`). See CLAUDE.md § Linting.
- Local build: `./build.sh --build appimage --clean no`. Catches
  patch failures unit tests miss.
- Branch: `fix/123-description` or `feature/123-description`.
- PR body links the issue: `Fixes #123` or `Refs #123`.
- AI-assisted? Add the attribution block (next section).

## Conventions in this file

### Patch-script regexes

Two rules apply to regexes that target the minified upstream bundle.

**Identifier captures use `[$\w]+`, not `\w+`.** Upstream's minifier
emits `$` inside JS identifiers (`C$i`, `g$i`, `i$A`). `\w` is
`[A-Za-z0-9_]` and does not match `$`, so a `\w+` capture against
`$e` returns the suffix `e` instead of the whole identifier. PR #555
and PR #627 closed two cohorts of patches with this exact bug. The
learnings doc has the full background and the canonical character
class is `[$\w]+` (the equivalent `[\w$]+` is fine; either form
matches the same set, the order is convention only).

**Intent comments accompany whitespace-tolerant patterns.** When a
patch regex uses `\s*` or `[ \t]*` between tokens, add a one-line
intent comment with whitespace stripped so the matched shape stays
readable:

```js
// Intent: VAR.code==="ENOENT"
const enoentRe = /([$\w]+)\.code\s*===\s*"ENOENT"/g;
```

Apply both rules to new patches and to existing regexes when you're
editing them for other reasons. No churn PRs. Background:
[the patching-minified-js learnings doc][pmj].

### Markdown prose wrapping

Wrap prose at ~80 chars, matching the bash column rule in
[docs/styleguides/bash_styleguide.md](docs/styleguides/bash_styleguide.md).
Tables, code blocks, URLs, alt text may exceed when breaking hurts
readability.
