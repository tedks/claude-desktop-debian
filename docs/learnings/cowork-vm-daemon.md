# Cowork VM Daemon — Learnings

> [!NOTE]
> **Status (2026-07): default on KVM hosts; the bwrap daemon is an
> opt-in fallback again.** The official client runs Cowork in a KVM
> microVM via its own `coworkd`. For hosts that can't do KVM/vhost-vsock
> (ChromeOS Crostini, [#772](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/772)),
> the bwrap daemon under [`scripts/cowork-fallback/`](../../scripts/cowork-fallback/)
> is wired back in as the `patch_cowork_bwrap` asar patch, dormant
> unless the user sets `COWORK_VM_BACKEND=bwrap`. The daemon now speaks
> the official helper's socket protocol
> ([`scripts/cowork-fallback/PROTOCOL.md`](../../scripts/cowork-fallback/PROTOCOL.md))
> rather than the 2.x Windows-pipe protocol. Sections below describe the
> 2.x lifecycle mechanics that still apply to the daemon internals;

## Issue #855 — Stale `rootfs.vhdx` Left Behind by the win32→unix Manifest Switch

Before Anthropic's manifest had a native `unix` platform key, this
project's pre-3.0 Linux support repurposed the **win32** manifest's
VHDX entries and converted `rootfs.vhdx` → `rootfs.qcow2` on first use
(the KVM backend in the old `scripts/cowork-vm-service.js`, now under
`scripts/cowork-fallback/`). The manifest has since grown a real
`unix.{arch}` entry serving `rootfs.img` directly
(`publishedAt: 2026-08-13` in one observed copy), which the official
`coworkd` uses natively — no `rootfs.qcow2` is ever produced from it.
The bwrap fallback doesn't use a rootfs image at all, so it's
unaffected either way. The 2.x KVM backend in `cowork-vm-service.js`
(~L1571) is the only code that ever read `rootfs.vhdx` (it converted
it to `rootfs.qcow2` on first use and never reads `rootfs.img`). That
code still exists but is unreachable in 3.x: the daemon only spawns
behind the asar gate `COWORK_VM_BACKEND=bwrap`
(`scripts/patches/cowork-bwrap.sh`, `GATE`), and that same value
selects the bwrap backend inside the daemon, so `KvmBackend` is never
constructed. Any other `COWORK_VM_BACKEND` value is a 2.x knob the
official client ignores (see `docs/configuration.md`).

Nothing deletes the old VHDX pair when a bundle created before that
switch picks up `rootfs.img`: a bundle from before ~2026-08 can carry
`rootfs.vhdx` + `rootfs.vhdx.zst` (~11 GB combined) forever alongside
a fully working `rootfs.img`. `cleanup_stale_vm_bundle_images` in
`scripts/launcher-common.sh` treats `rootfs.img` present as proof the
coworkd migration completed and removes the leftover files; a bundle
still on the old format alone is left untouched.

## Architecture Overview

Cowork mode on Linux uses a custom Node.js daemon
([`scripts/cowork-vm-service.js`](../../scripts/cowork-vm-service.js))
that replaces the Windows cowork-vm-service. The Electron app talks to
it over a Unix domain socket at
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cowork-vm-service.sock` using length-prefixed JSON —
the same wire format as the Windows named pipe.

The daemon is forked by **Patch 6** in the
`patch_cowork_linux()` function (`scripts/patches/cowork.sh`), which
injects auto-launch code into the Electron app's retry loop for the
VM-service connection.

## Daemon Lifecycle

1. First connect attempt: the app tries `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cowork-vm-service.sock`.
2. `ENOENT` / `ECONNREFUSED`: retry loop catches the error (the
   `ECONNREFUSED` branch is Linux-only, added by Patch 6 step 1 so
   stale sockets don't bypass retry).
3. Auto-launch (Patch 6 step 2): the injected code forks the daemon
   via `child_process.fork()` with `detached:true`, stdio redirected
   to `~/.config/Claude/logs/cowork_vm_daemon.log`.
4. Spawn cooldown: `FUNC._lastSpawn = Date.now()` — subsequent
   iterations only re-fork after 10 s have elapsed. This replaces the
   old one-shot `_svcLaunched` boolean so the retry loop can recover
   after mid-session daemon death (issue #408).
5. Retry: the loop waits and reconnects, which now succeeds.

## Issue #408 — Daemon Recovery

### Root cause (one-shot guard)

Before the fix, Patch 6 injected:

```javascript
process.platform==="linux" && !FUNC._svcLaunched && (
    FUNC._svcLaunched = true,
    /* fork daemon */
)
```

`FUNC._svcLaunched` was set on the first successful spawn and never
cleared, so when the daemon died mid-session the retry loop saw the
guard already set and skipped the re-fork. The client looped forever
on `connect ENOENT`.

### Fix (rate-limited respawn)

Timestamp-based cooldown replaces the boolean:

```javascript
process.platform==="linux" &&
(!FUNC._lastSpawn || Date.now() - FUNC._lastSpawn > 1e4) &&
(FUNC._lastSpawn = Date.now(), /* fork daemon */)
```

10 s is short enough that the retry loop (which sleeps on the order of
seconds between iterations) recovers promptly after a crash, and long
enough that a crash-looping daemon can't turn into a fork bomb.

### Secondary cause (preserved images block recovery)

The app's `_ue()` / `deleteVMBundle()` function deletes a whitelist of
reinstall files on auto-reinstall. Upstream deliberately preserves
`sessiondata.img` and `rootfs.img.zst` to avoid re-download.

On 1.2773.0 those preserved files put the daemon into an unstartable
state that persists across app restart and OS reboot. The client's
symptom is `connect ENOENT` (daemon never got far enough to create the
socket) rather than `ECONNREFUSED` (daemon started, crashed, socket
stayed). RayCharlizard (2026-04-16) confirmed that manually wiping
`~/.config/Claude/vm_bundles/claudevm.bundle/` is required to recover,
even after rolling back the AppImage to a known-good version.

### Fix (extend delete list — Patch 6b)

`scripts/patches/cowork.sh` now matches the `const NAME=["rootfs.img",...]` array at
module level and appends `"sessiondata.img"` and `"rootfs.img.zst"` if
they're not already present. The auto-reinstall path now wipes these
too. Trade-off: the next successful startup re-downloads/re-extracts
these files. Acceptable because auto-reinstall only runs after startup
has already failed — biasing toward recovery over re-download
avoidance is correct.

Not included in the delete list: `~/.config/Claude/claude-code-vm/`.
That's CLI-binary storage (`2.1.x/claude`), unrelated to the VM
daemon, and has its own version-check logic at `this.vmStorageDir`
inside the app. Wiping it would just force a slow re-download of the
CLI on every auto-reinstall.

## Silent Death — Now Logged

Before the fix the daemon was forked with `stdio:"ignore"`, and its
internal `log()` function was gated by `COWORK_VM_DEBUG=1`, so a crash
left no trace anywhere.

Two changes together make crashes visible:

1. **Patch 6 (client side)** redirects the forked daemon's stdout +
   stderr to `~/.config/Claude/logs/cowork_vm_daemon.log`. Any
   Node-level crash dump (uncaught exception pre-handler, native
   assertion, etc.) now lands in that file.
2. **`cowork-vm-service.js` (daemon side)** adds `logLifecycle()` —
   an always-on writer that bypasses `DEBUG` for startup, SIGTERM,
   SIGINT, `uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`, and `exit`
   events. It also proactively `mkdirSync`'s the log directory so the
   first write doesn't get swallowed if the daemon is the first thing
   writing under `~/.config/Claude/logs/`.

Interpreting the log after a failure:

| Last line | Diagnosis |
|-----------|-----------|
| `lifecycle startup ...` + gap + no further entries | SIGKILL'd (OOM killer, `kill -9`, etc.) — no handler fires |
| `lifecycle startup` + `lifecycle listening` + nothing else | Daemon running fine but died by signal with no handler (rare; check `dmesg`) |
| `lifecycle uncaughtException ...` | JS-level crash, stack is in the log entry |
| `lifecycle SIGTERM received` + `lifecycle exit code=0` | Clean app-initiated shutdown |
| No `startup` entry at all | `fork()` didn't complete; check launcher.log for `[cowork-autolaunch]` errors |
| No `cowork_vm_daemon.log` file at all **and** no `[cowork-autolaunch]` line | The auto-launch `fs.existsSync()` guard returned false — `app.asar.unpacked/` isn't traversable by the running user. Packaging perms bug; see [below](#packaging--appasarunpacked-must-be-traversable-by-the-run-time-user). |

## Packaging — `app.asar.unpacked/` must be traversable by the run-time user

Generalized into [`packaging-permissions.md`](packaging-permissions.md) —
the build-umask/ownership traps this bug uncovered and the current
deb/rpm/AppImage normalization blocks that close them.

## Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Is the daemon running?
pgrep -af cowork-vm-service

# Socket present?
ls -la "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/cowork-vm-service.sock"

# Watch lifecycle events as they happen
tail -f ~/.config/Claude/logs/cowork_vm_daemon.log

# Look for the last startup / exit pair
grep -E 'lifecycle (startup|exit|SIGTERM|SIGINT|uncaughtException|unhandledRejection)' \
    ~/.config/Claude/logs/cowork_vm_daemon.log | tail -20

# Find any orphan sockets
lsof -U 2>/dev/null | grep -iE 'cowork|claude'

# Force a respawn test: kill daemon, watch client log for reconnect
pkill -9 -f cowork-vm-service.js
tail -f ~/.cache/claude-desktop-debian/launcher.log

# Find the daemon script inside a mounted AppImage
find /tmp -path '*claude*cowork-vm-service*' 2>/dev/null
```

## Testing Notes

- **Host-direct** (`COWORK_VM_BACKEND=host`): no isolation, direct
  execution. Matches the `--doctor` "host-direct (no isolation, via
  override)" line. This is what issue #408 was reported against.
- **Bwrap** (`COWORK_VM_BACKEND=bwrap`): Bubblewrap sandbox; requires
  `bwrap` installed.
- **KVM** (`COWORK_VM_BACKEND=kvm`): full VM; requires QEMU, KVM,
  rootfs image.
- **Debug** (`COWORK_VM_DEBUG=1` or `CLAUDE_LINUX_DEBUG=1`): verbose
  logging via the existing `log()` path. `logLifecycle()` is always
  on regardless of this flag.
- **Force-cooldown test**: kill the daemon, relaunch a Cowork session
  within 10 s — the guard should block that single retry. Wait 10 s
  and retry: should succeed. Confirms the cooldown boundary.
