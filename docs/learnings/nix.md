# NixOS / Nix Flake Learnings

The Nix derivation repackages the official Claude Desktop `.deb`
(`fetchurl` + `autoPatchelfHook` over the bare co-located tree). The
v3.0.0 implementation is a best-attempt draft (ACQ-1) — @typedrat owns
the subsystem and the final shape. This page records the design
contract the implementation follows, the SRI auto-bump sed anchors,
and the resource-path knowledge from the deleted Windows-pipeline
derivation so nobody re-introduces the hack it needed.

**Source files:**

- [`nix/claude-desktop.nix`](../../nix/claude-desktop.nix) — the stub;
  its comment block is the design contract
- [`nix/fhs.nix`](../../nix/fhs.nix) — `buildFHSEnv` wrapper, still the
  flake's default output
- [`flake.nix`](../../flake.nix) — outputs and overlay wiring
- [`scripts/setup/official-deb.sh`](../../scripts/setup/official-deb.sh)
  — the pinned URL + SHA-256 the derivation will mirror
- [`.github/workflows/check-claude-version.yml`](../../.github/workflows/check-claude-version.yml)
  — the stub-guarded SRI auto-bump step

## Current state (v3.0.0 branch)

- `nix/claude-desktop.nix` implements the design below. Build- **and
  runtime**-verified on x86_64 + **nvidia** (real NixOS, both flake
  outputs: the app launches, GPU/EGL init is clean, locales load — see
  "The ANGLE GL trap" below for the fix that got it there). Cowork now
  boots a VM on x86_64 too: both gate requirements — `qemuPath` and
  `firmwarePath` — are satisfied in the FHS env, and a live boot with
  KVM acceleration and usermode networking has been confirmed on a host
  that already grants kvm-group access and has `vhost_vsock` loaded.
  **Not** yet verified: **mesa** (Intel/AMD, i.e. most NixOS users — the
  failing path is ANGLE's native-GL backend, and mesa picks backends
  differently, so it's the one GL config that didn't get exercised) and
  the aarch64 leg. One open question stays flagged inline: aarch64
  firmware naming in `nix/fhs.nix`.
- The Windows-installer derivation (7z-extract the exe, stock nixpkgs
  Electron, hand-built co-located resources tree, node-pty build) was
  deleted in the acquisition swap. Recover it from history:

  ```bash
  git log --oneline -- nix/claude-desktop.nix
  ```

- `flake.nix` is decoupled from node-pty; `nix/node-pty.nix` was
  deleted. The official `.deb` ships its own native bindings, so
  nothing in the flake compiles node modules anymore. The rework
  needed no `flake.nix` changes (outputs/overlay wiring unchanged:
  `claude-desktop`, `claude-desktop-fhs`, default = FHS env).
- `check-claude-version`'s "Update Nix SRI hashes" step is **live**
  now that the file carries a `version = "..."` line — keep the sed
  contract below intact or the auto-bump corrupts the file.
- Extraction gotcha the implementation hit: `dpkg-deb -x` **fails in
  the Nix sandbox** because chrome-sandbox is recorded SUID in
  `data.tar` and tar's mode-restore is refused; use
  `dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile | tar -x --no-same-owner
  --no-same-permissions` instead.

## The design contract

Per [`official-deb-rebase-verification.md`](official-deb-rebase-verification.md):

- **`fetchurl` the official `.deb`** from the official APT pool
  (`https://downloads.claude.ai/claude-desktop/apt/stable/pool/...`).
  The SRI hash comes from the APT `Packages` index — authoritative, no
  download needed to compute it. The pins in
  `scripts/setup/official-deb.sh` (`OFFICIAL_DEB_POOL_*`,
  `OFFICIAL_DEB_SHA256_*`) are the same values in hex form.
- **Unpack and `autoPatchelfHook` the official co-located tree.**
  nixpkgs precedent (verified against the nixpkgs tree): `discord` and
  `vscode` — both unpack a vendor tarball and `autoPatchelfHook` the
  bundled Chromium ELF in place. (`signal-desktop` is **not** precedent
  despite older notes here saying so: it is a *source* build run under
  nixpkgs `electron_42`, which Claude Desktop cannot use — see the
  resourcesPath section.) The official tree is bare co-located
  (`/usr/lib/claude-desktop/{claude-desktop, chrome-sandbox,
  resources/app.asar}`), so the derivation patches the shipped ELF
  instead of marrying the app to a nixpkgs `electron`.
- **No resourcesPath hack.** The official ELF already sits next to its
  `resources/` directory; `/proc/self/exe` resolves inside the app's
  own store path. See the retained section below for why this used to
  be the hard part.
- **`buildFHSEnv` (`nix/fhs.nix`) stays the default output.** MCP
  servers spawned by the app expect an FHS world (`nodejs`, `uv`,
  `docker`, ...); that rationale is unchanged from the Windows era.
- **The FHS env must bind-provide the OVMF CODE+VARS pair at the probed
  path.** Cowork's firmware probe list is hardcoded with no env
  override: x86_64 → `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.fd`,
  `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd`; arm64 →
  `/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF_CODE.fd`. It then derives the **writable VARS
  template** beside the CODE file it found by renaming
  `OVMF_CODE`→`OVMF_VARS` / `AAVMF_CODE`→`AAVMF_VARS`
  (`Qgi = A => A.replace("OVMF_CODE","OVMF_VARS").replace("AAVMF_CODE","AAVMF_VARS")`)
  and copies it per VM to seed efivars — `coworkd` aborts with *"no EFI
  variable-store template configured"* if that sibling is missing. So
  the shim must ship **both halves**; deb/rpm get away with a CODE-only
  symlink (CW-1) only because the distro's edk2 package already drops
  `OVMF_VARS` beside it. `nix/fhs.nix` closes it with a `runCommand`
  shim in `targetPkgs`: nixpkgs' `OVMF.fd` lands firmware at `FV/*.fd` —
  not under `share/` — so a bare OVMF never hits the probe; the shim
  symlinks the matched CODE+VARS pair into `share/OVMF/…` (x86_64, both
  Debian names aliased onto the single 4M-sized nixpkgs build) and
  `share/AAVMF/…` (aarch64: nixpkgs ships 64 MiB pflash-padded
  `AAVMF_{CODE,VARS}.fd` — verified present; the old `QEMU_EFI.fd`
  fallback was dropped, it is unpadded and has no matching VARS name).
  A build-time guard fails loudly if a source `FV/*.fd` is gone rather
  than ship a dangling symlink that only bites at VM boot — a
  build-behavior change for pinned aarch64 consumers, chosen because
  there is no clean fallback. Both arches' shim output is verified, and
  x86_64 now boots a VM live with it; aarch64 stays unverified.
- **The FHS env must also ship qemu.** Cowork's VM-boot gate checks a
  second requirement beyond firmware: `qemuPath`, found by searching
  PATH for `qemu-system-x86_64` / `qemu-system-aarch64`. `coworkd`
  (static Go) then launches a real `accel=kvm` guest — pflash OVMF,
  `vhost-vsock-pci`, virtiofsd `--shared-dir`, slirp usermode net.
  `nix/fhs.nix` adds `qemu_kvm` (the host-cpu-only build, ~1.5 GB
  closure vs 2.1 GB for the all-targets `qemu`) to `targetPkgs`, which
  lands the arch's `qemu-system-*` on `/usr/bin`. `/dev/kvm` and
  `/dev/vhost-vsock` are reachable inside the env — buildFHSEnv binds
  the whole `/dev` (`--dev-bind /dev /dev`) — but the host still has to
  provide them: `/dev/kvm` is `root:kvm 0660`, so a user outside the
  `kvm` group gets `EACCES` and coworkd's `accel=kvm` fails, and
  `/dev/vhost-vsock` doesn't exist until `vhost_vsock` is loaded (not a
  NixOS default). `--doctor` flags both. Firmware alone is necessary but
  not sufficient: without qemu the gate returns `requirement_missing`
  and the VM never boots.

Settled by the implementation: `autoPatchelfHook` covers the full
dependency surface (zero unsatisfied deps — main ELF, `virtiofsd`,
`chrome-native-host`; `coworkd` is static Go and skipped), and
`chrome-sandbox` SUID is dropped in favor of unprivileged user
namespaces (the NixOS default; standard stance for nixpkgs'
Chromium-based apps — no `--no-sandbox` anywhere).

### The ANGLE GL trap

The `autoPatchelf`-satisfied build still crash-looped at startup on
real NixOS: the GPU process failed EGL init with `Could not dlopen
native EGL: libEGL.so.1`, exited, and relaunched forever. Root cause,
traced on 1.18286.0:

- Chromium's bundled **ANGLE** lives in the co-located `libEGL.so` /
  `libGLESv2.so`. At GPU init it `dlopen()`s the glvnd dispatcher
  `libEGL.so.1` by bare soname.
- A `dlopen` resolves against the **calling object's** `DT_RUNPATH`
  (verified: `DT_RUNPATH` *is* honored for `dlopen`, unlike the common
  "RPATH only" lore — but it is not transitive). The ANGLE libs carry
  only their own `DT_NEEDED` on their runpath, not `libGL`, so the
  dispatcher is unfindable.
- `runtimeDependencies` does **not** fix this: `autoPatchelf` appends
  it to dynamic *executables* only (`auto-patchelf.py`,
  `if file_is_dynamic_executable: rpath += runtime_deps`), so it landed
  `libGL` on the main ELF but never on the `.so` that issues the
  `dlopen`.

Fix: `appendRunpaths` (which `autoPatchelf` applies to *every* patched
file) adds `${lib.getLib libGL}/lib` and
`${addDriverRunpath.driverLink}/lib` to all runpaths. Once ANGLE can
load glvnd's `libEGL.so.1`, NixOS-patched glvnd self-locates the vendor
ICD under `/run/opengl-driver`, so the second hop needs no extra wiring.
Chosen over a `makeWrapper --suffix LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (which nixpkgs'
`discord` uses) because the app spawns MCP servers (`node`, `uv`,
`docker`) — a wrapper would leak the driver tree into their environment;
a runpath edit is scoped to the ELFs that need it. Verified: both flake
outputs launch with clean GPU/EGL init on real NixOS x86_64 (nvidia).

**The Vulkan half needs a wrapper anyway.** ANGLE's native-GL backend is
what nvidia exercised. On mesa, if ANGLE falls through to its Vulkan
backend (or Chromium lands on SwiftShader), the co-located
`libvulkan.so.1` — the stock Khronos loader — searches the standard FHS
ICD dirs (`/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d`, …), which are empty on NixOS, and
finds no hardware driver. Runpath can't fix this: the loader keys on the
`VK_ADD_DRIVER_FILES`/`VK_DRIVER_FILES` env vars and fixed filesystem
paths, never `DT_RUNPATH`. So `installPhase` wraps the launcher to
prepend `${addDriverRunpath.driverLink}/share/vulkan/icd.d` to
`VK_ADD_DRIVER_FILES`. That var is *additive* (put before the standard
search, not replacing it), so a missing dir or a user's own setting still
wins — same dangling-safe property as `appendRunpaths`. This reintroduces
the one wrapper the GL fix avoided, but the leak is benign here: the
spawned MCP servers are CLI processes that never init Vulkan, and the ICD
dir is the correct value for any that did. This path is **unverified** —
the nvidia box never took the Vulkan branch; it's wired defensively for
the mesa configs that might.

### Host-helper paths inside app.asar

The official bundle spawns host helpers by absolute path:
`/usr/bin/secret-tool` (Chrome import outside KDE), `/usr/bin/busctl`
(KWallet preflight, GlobalShortcuts portal probe), `/bin/ps` and
`/usr/bin/pgrep` (process diagnostics), `/bin/bash` (the agent
toolset's persistent shell) and `/usr/bin/kwallet-query` (Chrome
import on KDE). NixOS has only `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/env`, so each
spawn fails with `ENOENT`. The FHS env provides `/usr/bin`, but it runs
the app under bwrap, and every Claude Code session the app spawns
inherits `NoNewPrivs` (no `sudo`) and an allowlisted `/etc`.

`nix/claude-desktop.nix` rewrites the quoted literals to store paths in
`postInstall` (`hostHelpers`); `kwallet-query` only with
`withKwallet = true`, because it pulls in Qt. Things the rewrite has to
get right:

- The build fails if a literal is missing before the rewrite, or still
  present in any quote style after it. The minifier has turned strings
  into template literals before (1.26832.0), and `substituteInPlace`
  only matches the double-quoted form.
- The bundled V8 code cache (`compile-cache/*.jsc`) is dropped for every
  patched chunk. V8 accepts a cache for an edit that keeps the source
  length and then runs the unpatched code.
- `asar pack --unpack` matches the glob against the crawled path, so the
  glob is built from absolute paths under the extraction root. Pack
  never clears a stale `app.asar.unpacked`, so it writes into a fresh
  directory, and the result is compared with the official unpacked set
  by content and by the new header.
- `asar extract` writes unpacked files 0644; the official modes are
  restored (`github-mcp-server` and the `.node` bindings are
  executable).

Electron's asar integrity check is macOS/Windows only, so the repacked
archive loads on Linux despite `EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation`.
`OnlyLoadAppFromAsar` is set, so an unpacked `resources/app` directory
is not an alternative to repacking.

### The SRI auto-bump contract

Once the stub is replaced, `check-claude-version` expects this shape
(from the workflow's sed anchors):

```nix
version = "1.18286.0";
# one hash per arch block, each closed by };
x86_64-linux = { url = "..."; hash = "sha256-..."; };
aarch64-linux = { url = "..."; hash = "sha256-..."; };
```

The workflow converts the Packages-index hex digest to SRI
(`xxd -r -p | base64`) and range-seds each arch block. Diverge from
this shape and the auto-bump silently rewrites the wrong hash — keep
exactly one `hash = "..."` per arch block.

## glibc floors the derivation inherits

From objdump on the official 1.18286.0 tree: the main Electron ELF
needs glibc **2.25**; `virtiofsd` and `chrome-native-host` need
**2.34** (matching the official `libc6 (>= 2.34)` Depends); `coworkd`
is static. On Nix this is mostly moot (nixpkgs glibc is well past
2.34), but it is the support boundary for anyone pinning an old
nixpkgs: the core app is more portable than the Depends line suggests,
and Cowork/browser-bridge are the 2.34-bound parts.

## Why the resourcesPath hack existed — and why it must not return

Kept from the Windows-pipeline era. The old derivation's central
problem is gone, but only because of how the official tree is laid
out — this section is the guard against reintroducing the hack (or
the failure it fixed) in the rework.

**The old problem:** the Windows-era derivation ran the app under the
nixpkgs `electron` package, so Electron and the app lived in separate
Nix store paths. Chromium computes `process.resourcesPath` from
`/proc/self/exe`, which resolved to `electron-unwrapped`'s store path;
the app's locale files, tray icons, and other resources lived
elsewhere and weren't found.

**`/proc/self/exe` resolves symlinks.** This is why `symlinkJoin` and
symlink-based trees don't work: the kernel follows symlinks to the
real binary, so `resourcesPath` always pointed at
`electron-unwrapped`'s directory. The only fix was a real copy of the
ELF into a tree that also contained the merged `resources/` (PR
[#368](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/pull/368)).

**The ENOENT was JS, not C++.** The `isPackaged=true` failure was
`readFileSync` loading `en-US.json` from `process.resourcesPath` at
module top-level in the minified bundle — before any wrapper could
correct the path. Claude Desktop is unusual among Electron apps in
loading locale JSONs from `resourcesPath` at module init with no
fallback, which is why the standard nixpkgs
`makeWrapper electron --add-flags app.asar` pattern (Obsidian, Vesktop)
was never enough here.

**And it's broader than locales.** Verified against the shipping
1.18286.0 bundle: when `isPackaged`, `process.resourcesPath` (no
fallback) also resolves the loose native helpers `virtiofsd`,
`cowork-linux-helper`, and the `smol-bin.*.img` Cowork VM images — all
shipped in `resources/` *outside* `app.asar`. Under a nixpkgs
`electron`, `resourcesPath` points at electron's own dir and every one
of these orphans, not just the locale JSONs. The locale loader is
`function _0t(){return isPackaged?process.resourcesPath:…}` feeding a
`readdirSync`/`readFileSync` of `${lang}.json`.

**There is no override.** No Electron env var or CLI flag overrides
`resourcesPath`; a `--resources-path` PR
([electron/electron#36114](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/36114))
was closed in Nov 2025 over security concerns, and the property was
made read-only in Electron 28.2.1.

**Why it's moot now:** the official `.deb` ships its own Electron ELF
bare co-located with `resources/` in one tree. The derivation copies
that tree into a single store path and patches the ELF in place, so
`/proc/self/exe` resolves inside the app's own tree and
`resourcesPath` is correct by construction. No nixpkgs `electron`, no
ELF-copy-plus-symlink-merge, no wrapper surgery. If a future rework is
ever tempted to swap the bundled ELF for a nixpkgs `electron` (e.g.
for CVE turnaround), this whole section becomes load-bearing again —
that path requires the PR #368 tree-merge technique, and the locale
JSONs (shipped loose in the official tree) are the first thing to
break.

One related constraint survives unchanged: the Nix store is
read-only, so any file-layout fix (firmware symlinks, resource
merges) must happen at build time in the derivation or via the FHS
env's bind layer — never "at runtime, add a symlink into the store."

## Testing Nix changes without NixOS

Kept from the Windows-pipeline era; the technique is unchanged.

A Fedora distrobox with the Nix package manager (Determinate Systems
installer, `--init none` for no-systemd containers) can build and run
the flake. The derivation produces identical store paths whether built
on NixOS or standalone Nix. Start the daemon manually with
`sudo nix-daemon &` before building.

This validates build success and basic app startup, but is not a
substitute for real NixOS testing (system integration, desktop
environment, Cowork's KVM path). The v3.0.0 x86_64 build verification
ran exactly this way (container `nixtest`, Fedora 43 + Determinate
Nix); the remaining validation gaps in "Current state" above are the
things a container cannot prove.
